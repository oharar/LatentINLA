## LatentINLA Readme

This package is made to play around with latent variable models in INLA.

## To Do

- look at speeding it up
- are initial values going to help with speed or convergence?
- Try a constrained model
- Try a spatial model, making the site scores spatial rather than iid.
- plant some trees to offset the atmospheric warning created by running
  these models
